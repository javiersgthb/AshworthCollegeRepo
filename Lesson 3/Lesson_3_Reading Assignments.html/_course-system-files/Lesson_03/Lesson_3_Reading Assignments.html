<h2>Lecture Notes</h2>

<div class="col-xs-12 ">
<p>Artists often refer to the following quote: "A blank canvas is an open opportunity to create whatever your imagination can stir to life"(Retrieved from: <a href="http://www.ericwitkowski.com/2013/04/why-use-ide.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.ericwitkowski.com/2013/04/why-use-ide.html</a>):</p>
Artists begin with a medium and then use that medium to bring their ideas to life. Some artists use paint, some stone, some sand, and some even resort to using natural elements, such as ice and snow. All successful artists have mastery of their tools in order to maximize their skill set.
<p>Visual C# is a specialized skill set. The programmer not only develops code to control the application but also designs the interface in which the user uses the program. This is an important concept, because the misplacement of a button or inadvertent hiding of certain options can generate an immense amount of disdain from end users. It is impossible to overstate how important the correct tool set is to programmers. Much like artists need to understand and use their tools appropriately, programmers must do the same. Failure to do so will result in overcomplicated code, causing projects to run over time and over budget. Using tool sets properly will enhance the programmer&rsquo;s ability to create enterprise-level applications that provide value to end users and development teams alike.</p>
<p>This lesson will cover the most important tool you will ever use in your programming career, the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The last lesson touched upon this concept, but this lesson dedicates an entire chapter of the textbook to exploring this instrument. Many different IDEs are available to programmers, but as you have learned in previous lessons, the choice of a programming language depends on the hardware on which you intend to run your applications. Much in the same vein, the IDE you choose is dependent on the language you want to program with. Other IDEs include IBM's Eclipse, which supports Java natively; Anjuta, which supports a number of object-oriented languages but runs on Linux; and SharpDevelop, a free and popular IDE that supports a number of languages and is maintained by an open source community of software developers. When it comes to programming with Visual C#, however, one of the best IDEs available (if not the best) is Visual Studio</p>
<p>Visual Studio natively supports .NET languages, including C#, VB.NET, ASP.NET, and F#, as well as a wide number of community-sourced plugins. Visual Studio also has a rich history with programmers, because the first version of the development platform was made available to users in 1995! Microsoft has continued to upgrade and enhance the tools available for programmers as it has developed its programming languages as well. More recently, as the .NET initiative has taken flight, Microsoft has released a version of Visual Studio to match releases of its .NET Framework, which has been every 2 to 3 years or so. Why do this? The answer is simple. As new programming features and upgrades are made available to the .NET Framework, Visual Studio's latest tools will reflect those changes and features, allowing programmers to upgrade both existing applications and new applications to use those features.</p>
<p>You may not be aware, but the .NET SDK (Software Development Toolkit) is available through Microsoft's website. You can use this SDK to install all the features necessary to compile a defined program, review any errors, resolve them, and then recompile the program to create your very own executable file. Best of all, this SDK is completely free! This means that you can actually write programs in any old-fashioned text editor (such as Notepad), and then run the commands necessary to compile those files into an application.</p>
<p>You might be asking yourself, why wouldn't we do this? This is exactly what this chapter is all about&mdash;showcasing and understanding the purpose of the IDE, as well as learning to navigate all the appropriate options. The .NET SDK provides the capabilities listed above, but it is very raw, basic, and obtuse. With Visual Studio however, the programmer has the capability to perform the functions listed above, but is also provided several benefits, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>IntelliSense (real-time object exploration)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Code formatting</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Debugging and diagnostics</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Deployment options and code refactoring</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Testing tools</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Development platform support</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Architecture and modeling</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Lab management</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Team collaboration tools</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Integration with other Microsoft products (such as SQL Server Databases or SharePoint-powered websites)</li>
</ul>
<p>Needless to say, there are enough features in Visual Studio to teach an entire course! Most of these features, including the ones previously mentioned, are slightly ahead of what we need to discuss thus far. As you increase your skill set with programming in Visual C#, more features will become handy in Visual Studio. Today, we will discuss the basic features that every programmer will need to know. At the end of this lesson, you will have a solid understanding of how to manage project solutions, explore solution files, view/edit object properties, and even design Windows forms! Armed with these tools, you will be ready to explore the next lessons, where we put these tools to the test.</p>
