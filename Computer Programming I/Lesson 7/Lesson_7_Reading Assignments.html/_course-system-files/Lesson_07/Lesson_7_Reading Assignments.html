<h2>Lecture Notes</h2>
</div>
<div class="col-xs-12 ">
<p>In our last lesson, we took a look into the visual aspects of Visual C#. Object-oriented principles are a powerful and vast area of programming, and it is important that you learn how to properly design classes for proper maintenance and reusability. However, the visual abilities of programming with C# are equally important. Appropriately engaging your users with easy-to-use navigation and providing them with dynamic data results in a timely manner are essential skills.</p>
<p>When visual programming first became available to programmers several years ago, the ability to "drag and drop" controls to a screen or allow freeform text in a text area was enough reason to try using Windows Forms projects. As computers became more powerful and prevalent in businesses and homes alike, end users were able to take advantage of the new functionality that was available, and Windows Forms designs made them available for only a nominal fee. In fact, some people purchased the software simply to "push their PCs to the max," similar to those who buy a sports car and take to the highway "just because."</p>
<p>The novelty has now worn off. Users are no longer impressed with a PictureBox showing a company logo and a textbox where a user can enter a phone number. As thrilling as it must have been to build a basic Windows Forms application in your last lesson, I would bet that you hadn't programmed anything that you hadn't seen before. And that's perfectly fine! As you can see, each lesson is a building block to make you a more complete programmer than what you were, which is certainly the purpose of this lesson as well.</p>
<p>This lesson presents several unique controls, including Menu, MonthCalendar, DateTimePicker, LinkLabel, ListBox, CheckedListBox, ComboBox, TreeView, ListView, and TabControl (say that five times fast!). The most common controls used by the majority of applications&mdash;PictureBox, Label, and TextBox, in particular&mdash;were presented in the previous lesson. I love these controls! They're dependable, well written, and rich with properties to provide a lot of value to your end users for very little investment. I view these controls like I view my hammer and screwdriver. Time tested and mother approved, they're always handy and seem to be applicable to any project I'm working on. The more unique controls mentioned above are similar to the dovetail saw or a drill press; they may not be something that you "need," but using them results in a better end product.</p>
<p>Properly understanding your toolbox (figuratively and literally here, as all controls are available in your Toolbox window) will allow you to design and deliver forms that look better and run better. End users don't like to wait, and they shouldn't have to. The best applications available to end users today run fast, and if they're not running fast they provide the end user with a message indicating that information is on the way. Window's Forms projects have a tremendous ability to provide a data-centric design, and with modernized databases it's not uncommon to have the ability to retrieve and display hundreds or thousands of rows of data to your users. It is also with these types of scenarios that the skilled and experienced programmer can appropriately use his or her toolbox to not overwhelm the PC with data, causing any speed or lag issues.</p>
<p>It has been said many times "the devil is in the details," and that statement couldn't ring any truer than in programming. There's a fine line between an application and a good application, and it's the details that makes an application good. Designing well-thought-out menus and making them available to end users will keep them happy and using your product. Entering the date and time should be a simple process for any user, but what if a user is from out of the country and is accustomed to entering the year first, rather than last? Using a DateTimePicker control trivializes this scenario, as you can be assured that a date and time is available by only a mouse click, and that the format presented to the user is standardized based on the property value the programmer has specified.</p>
<p>As you can see, these aren't controls you will always need to use, but knowing that they are available is half the battle. Knowing how to implement them is the other half of the battle, of course, which includes being familiar with their properties and methods. So what do you say? Are you ready to learn about these unique and interesting controls?</p>
