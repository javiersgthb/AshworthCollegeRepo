<p>"I think it's more like we both had this rich neighbor named Xerox and I broke into his house to steal the TV set and found out that you had already stolen it."</p>
<p>&mdash;Bill Gates to Steve Jobs on accusations of stealing proprietary information from Apple</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The past few lessons have focused intently on the nonvisual aspects of C#. You have learned about console projects, C# keywords, and variable declaration. You have looked at various options for accepting variable input from the console window and how to work with that data. You then moved on to analyzing OOP concepts to understand object construction from a programmer-defined class, which involved methods and properties to make the class perform some functions and store some data. Although this information is critical to your career (in the last lesson I informed you it would be the most important concept you would ever learn), it's not always the "fun" or "inspiring" part of the programmer's career. Don't get me wrong, there have been many times I have been enthralled with the code I was writing to make a particular product work, but end users will never be exposed to the code you write.</p>
<p>No matter how advanced, efficient, or well commented your code may be, the end user is only impressed by the visual elements of the program's interface. For example, the mainframe, which was at one point the modern marvel of computing, eventually would become a laughingstock. Why? I'll give you a hint: "green screens." It's not the system architects who have demeaned the value of these "green screen" systems; in fact, some are still in use today and are incredibly powerful in the appropriate business environment. However, with green screens, the end users only see a limited visual display, which they inherently attribute to antiquated computing power, all because they don't see a clickable button!</p>
<p>Once a technology's novelty wears off, if the interface isn't easy to use and/or well designed, the end user will discount the need, purpose, or value of the software. It is for this reason that such harsh emotions would bear themselves in our opening quotation from Bill Gates (founder of Microsoft) to Steve Jobs (the late cofounder of Apple). It is a modern technology now, but in the mid-1990s the ability to have a home computer was impressive, and one that had an interactive interface with "clickable" elements was considered something out of the 21st century! Windows 95 by Microsoft made incredible advancements in the personal computing business. Windows was already an operating system, but it was Windows 95 that provided some real bluster to the computing market. It provided visual items that appeared based on hovering with a mouse, clickable buttons, and relevant help windows when an error occurred. All of this is considered standard now, but at the time it was considered state-of-the-art. So visually impressive was Windows 95 that Microsoft also sold a theme pack called Windows Plus for $99 that provided extra desktop themes, sounds, and icons, and owners of Windows 95 happily purchased this item as well!</p>
<p>With the visual enhancements provided by companies such as Microsoft and Apple, the ability to create these interfaces eventually became available to programmers as well. An early success in the visual programming world was Visual Basic (VB), a programming counterpart to C# that showcased programming from a visual capacity. Now, VB is considered part of the OOP community because of its ability to create objects and provide inheritance and encapsulation and class libraries for C# projects. At the time of its release, however, its primary purpose was to provide a programmer the means to develop a program with visual interactivity. Over the next 20 years or so, as the Internet became more popular, ASP.NET became another Microsoft-powered visual alternative to creating applications for end-user interaction. However, as programming teams have sought to expose the end-user's raw computing potential, access local data, or even access other resources, such as specialized input devices or output devices, Windows Forms projects have become the de facto standard.</p>
<p>And so, that brings us to your textbook reading. In case you didn't notice the Reading Assignment yet, we are going to jump around in the textbook a little. You have been exposed to the building blocks of programming; now it's time to examine the visual elements of programming and even start to grasp why something takes place when you click a button or enter a password into a textbox but not see any letters! Programming is all about specificity; the computer only does what the programmer tells it to do. In a visual sense, programming is no different, because the programmer must edit the appropriate properties of a control or edit code to handle button clicks or other choices. However, the really exciting part of programming with a visual element is that you can programmatically alter the properties of a control as well. Imagine being able to add a textbox to a form based on the response of a button click by the end user or removing the ability to click on a checkbox because the end user has yet to provide certain information. These are just a few basic examples of the power of programming with Visual C#.</p>
<p>In a previous lesson, you learned about the difference between the presentation layer and the business logic layer. The majority of what you have studied can be attributed to business logic. However, there is some crossover of this knowledge, and so today you&rsquo;ll begin your exploration of the presentation layer of Visual C# by using Windows Forms and controls.</p>
