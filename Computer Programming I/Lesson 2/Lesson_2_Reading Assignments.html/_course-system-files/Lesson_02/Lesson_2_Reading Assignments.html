<h2>Text Readings</h2>
<p><em>Visual C#&reg; 2017: How to Program</em>,&nbsp;Chapter 1.</p>
<p>In your textbook, carefully study Chapter 1. The self-review section can help ensure your understanding of the material. Remember, these are the building blocks of the future of your programming career. A solid understanding of the concepts presented will help you grasp future information as well. You are strongly encouraged to complete the Self-Review Exercises at the end of the chapter and to check the answers to insure that you have grasped the main chapter concepts. We encourage you to go back and review any summary points that feel foreign to lock in what you just learned.</p>

<h2>Lecture Notes</h2>

<div class="col-xs-12 ">
<p>Steve Jobs, the co-founder and chief visionary for Apple, once said, "Technology is nothing. What's important is that you have a faith in people, that they're basically good and smart, and if you give them tools, they'll do wonderful things with them." Today's technology offers some amazing capabilities; programmers are like artists, and we are surrounded by canvases on which to perform our work. As Steve Jobs indicated, you need the tools to work with, so today you will learn about the most important device you will use for programming&mdash;the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Using the IDE, programmers can design screen layouts, write code, find errors in code, and promote their applications to users.</p>
<p>This lesson is all about building blocks. You need to have a solid grasp of the basics of this wonderful and robust programming language. Much like a programmer working in an office, you may be thinking, "All I want to do is write code!" and you will, once we work through a few more details.</p>
<p>As you read this lecture, be sure to develop a solid understanding of the importance of hardware, which is where the lesson discussion begins. No matter how simple or sophisticated the applications are that you will write (and you will write many!), application performance is heavily reliant on the hardware and technical capabilities of the hosting computer. However, you are learning to program at a wonderful time! The lesson also makes reference to Windows Azure, a very good cloud computing service available to programmers. According to Microsoft, &ldquo;Azure is an open and flexible cloud platform that enables you to quickly build, deploy and manage applications across a global network of Microsoft-managed datacenters. You can build applications using any language, tool or framework. And you can integrate your public cloud applications with your existing IT environment&rdquo; (Retrieved from: <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-azure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="background-color: #ffffff;">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-azure/</a>)</p>
<p>Cloud computing takes the hardware&ndash;software model and turns it on its head. Have you ever been driving in your car and wished you had a little more gas, a little faster engine, or a little more trunk space? That is what cloud computing does! It gives you more storage, speed, and availability for your applications when you need them. As I said, you are learning to program at a wonderful time. For example,</p>
<blockquote>Azure delivers a flexible cloud platform that can satisfy any application need. It enables you to reliably host and scale out your application code within compute roles. You can store data using relational SQL databases, NoSQL table stores, and unstructured blob stores, and optionally use Hadoop and business intelligence services to data-mine it. You can take advantage of Azure&rsquo;s robust messaging capabilities to enable scalable distributed applications, as well as deliver hybrid solutions that run across a cloud and on-premises enterprise environment. Azure&rsquo;s distributed caching and CDN services allow you to reduce latency and deliver great application performance anywhere in the world. (Retrieved from: <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-azure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="background-color: #ffffff;">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-azure/</a>)</blockquote>
<p>Pay special attention to the "Object Technology" section in the text reading assignment. Object-oriented programming is at the heart of using C# and many of today&rsquo;s languages, and, as indicated above, learning begins with building blocks. So be sure to understand the terminology mentioned in this section of the text. If you are able to identify and recall the meaning of the highlighted terms, it will only accelerate your learning experience, not just with C#, but with all object-oriented languages you learn!</p>
<p>Before diving into the IDE to "test drive" your first application, the lesson will also discuss Microsoft .NET. Although .NET is a Microsoft-specific platform (meaning it runs on Microsoft systems), the .NET movement remains one of the most popular programming platforms today, and it provides a great deal of opportunity and flexibility to work with other developers who use&nbsp;<em>different</em>&nbsp;languages! This means that you and a team of other C# developers can write for applications that also make use of Visual Basic or ASP.NET, because the compiler will understand all of the commands.</p>
<p>The end of the lesson rounds out with our first Visual Studio solution, "Painter." With Painter, you will be supplied with source code for an application that you can run on your own computer and interact with. To use Painter, and also to get the most out of this course, you will need to do two things on your computer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visit&nbsp;<a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="background-color: #ffffff;">https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/</a>. From this page, download Visual Studio Community for Windows Desktop. Once downloaded, install this software, which will allow you to create and run software solution files with C#.</li>
<li>Visit&nbsp;<a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/bc/abp/cs-resources/products/product.html#product,isbn=0134601548" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://media.pearsoncmg.com/bc/abp/cs-resources/products/product.html#product,isbn=0134601548</a>&nbsp;the Pearson Higher Education website for your course textbook. From the site, download the code samples for all of the chapters. You will use many of the code samples provided here, and in particular the code samples for Chapter 1 in this lesson.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find more information about Visual Studio and the Pearson Higher Education code examples in the preface of your course textbook. Once you have performed these two steps, turn the page in your textbook and get started! Remember to click through and follow all examples provided in the text, because practice makes perfect.</p>
